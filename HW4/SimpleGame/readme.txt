We have created a 9-puzzle game.
The 9-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle which is consisted of numbered square tiles in a random order with one tile missing (the "zero" tile). 
The players objective is to rearange the puzzle in such way that the puzzle reaches the winning state within a maximal number of steps allowed. The player can move frames only by swaping (sliding) between the 0 frame and the 0 frame neighbors. 
The winning state is:
+---+---+---+
